Project Idea and Project Aims

Tara boutique is a specialized flower shop that aims to provide customers with tailored floral arrangements based on the specific occasion or event they are celebrating. 
Whether it's a baby shower, graduation, wedding, or birthday, the boutique will offer a wide range of flower options and designs to suit each event's unique atmosphere and style.
The reason we chose the name Tara is because it symbolizes true, strong, cohesive, serious, far-reaching friendship, and this indicates the bond of friendship that brings us together through Teamwork.
